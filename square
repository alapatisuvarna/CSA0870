Write a python program to find the difference between the sum of the squares of 
the first two hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Input & Output: 
The sum of the squares of the first twenty natural numbers is,
12+22+32+.....+202 = 2870
The square of the sum of the first twenty natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 44100

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first twenty natural 
numbers and the square of the sum is 44100 - 2870 = 41230 Output: 401323300
program:
def sum_of_squares(n):
    return sum(x**2 for x in range(1, n+1))
def square_of_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))**2
n = 200
difference = square_of_sum(n) - sum_of_squares(n)
print("Difference between the sum of squares and square of sum:", difference)
