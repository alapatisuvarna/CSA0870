python program to find whether it contains an additive sequence or not
program:
def is_additive_sequence(sequence):
    if len(sequence) < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(sequence)):
        if sequence[i] != sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]:
            return False
    return True
sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]  
if is_additive_sequence(sequence):
    print("The sequence is an additive sequence.")
else:
    print("The sequence is not an additive sequence.")
