Calculate the number of days, months and years taken for you to join in college 
from your date of birth. 

Also check whether the year of date of birth or date of joining is a leap year. 
If the years are exceeding 19, and also you have born on the leap year, then 
print “I am lucky adult and adult means responsibility: Otherwise print “ I am 
aspiring to become an responsible adult“

Enter the date of birth: 2003 11 18
Enter the date of joining: 2021 10 08

Sample Output:
